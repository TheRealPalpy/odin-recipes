        <p>This is a Pasta dough recipe for creating Pasta from scratch. This recipe originates from <strong>Thomas Keller</strong> a <strong>3 Michelin Star Chef </strong>from the United States</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h2>
        <uo>
            <li>500 grams Tipo “00” flour</li>
            <li>250 grams egg yolks (ideally from Jidori hens)</li>
            <li>1 whole egg</li>
            <li>15–30 grams milk</li>
            <li>25 grams extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        </uo>
        <ol>
            <li>In the center of a large cutting board or pasta board, place the flour in a mound. Use a bench scraper in hand, set aside about 1/6 of the flour. This flour is reserved for if your dough is too wet, as it is easier to add flour to a wet dough than to add liquid to a dry dough</li>
            <li>Make a large well in the center of the mound</li>
            <li>Pour in the yolks, the whole egg, milk, olive oil, and salt</li>
            <li>With two fingers, begin swirling the ingredients together, incorporating in flour a little bit at a time, until it becomes a thick paste</li>
            <li>Use the bench scraper to fold flour over the paste and cut in the flour</li>
            <li>Once the flour as been in- corporated, knead the dough until it resembles a smooth ball</li>
            <li>If the dough is very sticky, add a small amount of the reserve flour as needed. It takes practice to know when the dough has reached the right tightness</li>
            <li>Put dough into a sealable plastic storage bag and refrigerate at least 4–5 hours so that the gluten has time to relax before rolling out the pasta. The dough can also be made a day ahead.</li>
        </ol>
