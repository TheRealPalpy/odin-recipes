        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <uo>
            <li>3 zucchini, green and/or Goldbar</li>
            <li>6–8 ounces neutral-flavored/li>
            <li>plant-based oil</li>
            <li>Vierge sauce</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>Finishing salt</li>
        </uo>
        <ol>
            <li>Halve the zucchini lengthwise and score the flesh in a crosshatch pattern so that the salt can penetrate it. “Rain” or “snow” salt onto the scored side of the zucchini from a height that allows it to evenly distribute</li>
            <li>Leave the zucchini for 10–15 minutes so that salt has time to draw out mois- ture, which will help maintain the density of the vegetable as it cooks</li>
            <li>Pat the zucchini dry</li>
            <li>Heat canola oil (use just enough to coat the bottom of the pan) in a 12-inch fry pan until it’s shimmering and just beginning to smoke</li>
            <li>Add the zucchini flesh side down in the oil, adjust the heat to allow the zucchini to sear and caramelize without burning</li>
            <li>Cook about 5 minutes, then add herbs or garlic and immediately place the pan in a 450°F oven to roast for 25–30 minutes or until the zucchini are completely soft</li>
            <li>Transfer zucchini to paper towel–lined plate to blot excess oil. Arrange the zucchini on a serving platter. Then spoon the vierge sauce over the top, following by a sprinkling of finishing salt.</li>
